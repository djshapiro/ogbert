## Optimally Generating Bucks E Robotically Trading

("e" is Portuguese for "and")

## What is it?

Right now, it's a dream. I want to use a machine learning library to generate a day-trading algorithm that I can backtest with all the BitCoin price data that Ogbert has saved for me. I need to learn more about TensorFlow first. Please hold.
